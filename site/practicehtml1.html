	Coronavirus (COVID-19) Tracker India News Live Updates: In a routine press briefing on the coronavirus situation in the country, the Health Ministry Friday said that 3,234 patients have recovered in the last 24 hours. A total of 48,534 COVID-19 patients, which is about 41 per cent of total cases, have recovered so far, the ministry added. Even by a simple model, at least 14-29 lakh coronavirus cases and between 37,000 and 71,000 deaths have been averted, said the Centre Friday, highlighting how India has been able to contain the virus through early implementation of nationwide lockdown. Meanwhile, member of NITI Aayog Dr V K Paul said that the growth rate of the virus was controlled by India. “You can imagine how it would have been if growth had continued at 22 per cent. The doubling time has come down from 3.5 days to 13.5 days because of the lockdown,” said Dr Paul.</p>
